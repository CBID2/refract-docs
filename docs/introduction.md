# What is Refract?

Refract is a fictional, React-inspired JavaScript framework designed to give technical writers a playground for building rich and structured documentation. It introduces concepts like refractions, lenses, and optics to simulate a complex, modern front-end library.

## Why Refract?

Refract focuses on a core set of principles to provide a focused and efficient developer experience:

- **Clarity:** Refract's component model is designed to be highly intuitive. Components are self-contained and easy to understand, reducing complexity in large applications.
- **Performance:** The framework's architecture is optimized for speed, ensuring your applications load quickly and feel responsive to the user.
- **Scalability:** By using "refractions," the framework allows you to build complex applications from simple, reusable components, making it ideal for projects of any size.

## Core Concepts

Refract's foundation is built on three key concepts that work together to simplify your development process:

- **Refractions** handle your application's state, providing a way to represent a single piece of data in a clear and isolated unit. They can be composed to build more complex state models.
- **Lenses** give you fine-grained control over component capabilities by focusing on and manipulating specific pieces of data within a refraction.

- **Optics** provide a way to build and reuse logic by composing multiple refractions and lenses to create new, higher-order components.

This architectural trifecta results in clean, readable code and applications that are both highly performant and easy to maintain.

## How it Works

At its core, Refract uses a simple, declarative API. You define your components using a `createComponent` function, which automatically handles rendering and updates. The framework uses a lightweight virtual DOM to efficiently update the browser, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Use Cases

Refract can be applied to a wide range of projects such as building:

- **Dynamic Dashboards:** Create dashboards that update in real-time with complex, live data.

- **Interactive Forms:** Build powerful and responsive forms that handle user input with ease.

- **Single-Page Applications (SPAs):** Develop fluid and fast web apps where navigation and content updates happen without page reloads.
